# Lucky TImer - Casino game project in Windows Forms C#
Semestral project for Component-based SW Development classes.  

***Overview***  

Lucky Timer is an engaging casino game developed using Windows Forms in C#. The game combines elements of chance and strategy, allowing players to place bets and attempt to cash out before the timer stops. The longer a player waits to cash out, the higher their potential winnings become. However, if the timer stops before cashing out, the bet is deducted from the player's wallet. The game also includes user registration and login functionality, with new users receiving a generous starting balance of 200 credits. The last wallet balance is saved for returning players.  

This project showcases several key aspects of software development:

**1. MySQL Database Integration**  

The game integrates with a MySQL database to manage user registration, login, and wallet balances. This demonstrates proficiency in working with database.  

**2. Game Logic**  

The game incorporates complex game logic, including bet calculations, timer management, and payout mechanics. It showcases the ability to design and implement intricate game rules.  

**3.  User Authentication and Data Persistence**  

Users can register accounts and log in, with their wallet balance persistently stored between sessions. This highlights knowledge of user authentication and session management.  
User data, including wallet balances, is stored in a database, demonstrating data persistence skills.  

**4. Windows Forms UI**  

Lucky Timer features a user-friendly Windows Forms interface, demonstrating the ability to design and implement a visually appealing and interactive graphical user interface.
