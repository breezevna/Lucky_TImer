This is a prototype of a casino game. In which you can create an account, all data and money will be saved. The rules are simple, you need to pick up the money before the timer stops. The longer you don't take the money, the bigger the prize. And if you do not have time to pick up before the timer stops, then the money is withdrawn from the account.
